This repository contains some very rough experimentation with Rust implementations of IP address lookup algorithms, both my own and comparison with those of others.

This is just a learning playground for myself, it is not intended to be used in deployed applications.

The repository is named after the https://blog.nlnetlabs.nl/donkeys-mules-horses/ article.
