This repository contains some very rough experimentation with Rust implementations of IP address lookup algorithms, both my own and comparison with those of others.

This is just a learning playground for myself, it is not intended to be used in deployed applications.

The repository is named after the https://github.com/NLnetLabs/try-tries-and-trees/ repository.
